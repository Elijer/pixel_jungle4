# Plants
It might be a good idea to really lean into the idea of lichen and actually make it only yield like, 2 energy, making it very hard to get ahead, but also sort of addicting. I worry that providing TOO much energy just sort of lowers the ceiling in a ton of ways. There could just be 4 plants levels, but the rarity of some makes it so that making it there is genuinely kind of difficult.

Keep in mind, the reason I DIDN'T do this at first is I didn't want to make the game too much about just click bashing. I'll see what the gameplay is actually like and go from there.
