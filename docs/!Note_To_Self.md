Working on player energy decrement events.
Rendering these changes is 60% there - notes in handleEnergyDrainCycles
To continue, you may need to create a table of sockets - not the IDs, but a way to actually store all connections
So that they can be iterated through, and players can be updated with their energy level

However, need to add new class of events and user experience:
- death
- restart
- showing energy level
- messages about energy, etc.

Do just a little design before creating this part of API.

Good luck!
