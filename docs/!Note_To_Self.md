Working on player energy decrement events.
Rendering these changes is 60% there - notes in handleEnergyDrainCycles

However, need to add new class of events and user experience:
- death
- restart
- showing energy level
- messages about energy, etc.

Do just a little design before creating this part of API.

Good luck!
